# experience
Experience is a multi-sensorial project that aims to make you travel through sound, smells, and light.

To deploy the app, you need to :

1) Create a virtual environment in the current directory:
    python3 -m venv venv

2) Activate the virtual environment:
  On Mac/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
  On Windows:
    call venv\scripts\activate.bat

3) Install the required libraries (most notably, fbs and PyQt5):
    pip install fbs PyQt5==5.9.2 pyinstaller==3.4
